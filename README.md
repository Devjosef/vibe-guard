#  Vibe-Guard Security Scanner

**Catches the security mistakes we all make when we code quickly**

Zero dependencies ‚Ä¢ Instant setup ‚Ä¢ Works everywhere ‚Ä¢ 10 essential security rules

##  Quick Start (Choose Your Style)

### Option 1: One-Line Install (Recommended)
```bash
# macOS/Linux - installs to /usr/local/bin
curl -L https://get-vibe-guard.sh | bash

# Then use anywhere:
vibe-guard scan .
```

### Option 2: Download Binary Directly
```bash
# macOS
curl -L https://github.com/user/vibe-guard/releases/latest/download/vibe-guard-macos -o vibe-guard
chmod +x vibe-guard
./vibe-guard scan .

# Linux
curl -L https://github.com/user/vibe-guard/releases/latest/download/vibe-guard-linux -o vibe-guard
chmod +x vibe-guard
./vibe-guard scan .

# Windows
# Download vibe-guard-win.exe from releases page
```

### Option 3: NPM (for Node.js users)
```bash
npx vibe-guard scan .
# or
npm install -g vibe-guard
vibe-guard scan .
```

### Option 4: Docker (for CI/CD)
```bash
# Scan current directory
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/code vibe-guard scan /code

# Scan specific file
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/code vibe-guard scan /code/app.js
```

##  Why You'll Actually Use This

- **Zero Setup**: Download and run, no Node.js or dependencies required
- **Fast Enough to Not Be Annoying**: Scans your entire project in seconds
- **Won't Spam You**: Smart enough to know test code from real issues
- **Made by Developers**: We know what actually breaks in production
- **Works Everywhere**: macOS, Linux, Windows, Docker, CI/CD - you name it

##  What It Catches (All 10 Rules)

### üö® Critical Issues (The Bad)
- **Exposed API Keys**: AWS, GitHub, Google, Slack, Stripe tokens in your code
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: Database passwords, JWT secrets, encryption keys
- **Database URLs**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL connection strings with credentials

### ‚ö†Ô∏è High-Risk Issues (The Ugly)
- **Missing Authentication**: Unprotected admin routes and API endpoints
- **SQL Injection**: String concatenation in database queries
- **Directory Traversal**: Unsafe file path operations
- **Open CORS**: Wildcard origins that let anyone access your API

### üìã Medium Issues (The not so Good)
- **Unvalidated Input**: Direct use of user input without checks
- **Insecure HTTP**: Using HTTP instead of HTTPS
- **Vulnerable Dependencies**: Outdated packages with known security issues
- **Missing Security Headers**: No helmet.js or manual security headers

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Scan current directory (most common)
vibe-guard scan .

# Scan specific file
vibe-guard scan app.js

# JSON output for CI/CD
vibe-guard scan . --format json

# Quick syntax (same as scan)
vibe-guard .

# Show version
vibe-guard --version
```

## üîß CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Security Scan
  run: |
    curl -L https://get-vibe-guard.sh | bash
    vibe-guard scan .
```

### GitLab CI
```yaml
security_scan:
  script:
    - curl -L https://get-vibe-guard.sh | bash
    - vibe-guard scan .
```

### Docker in CI
```yaml
- name: Security Scan
  run: docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/code vibe-guard scan /code
```

## Who This Is For

- **When you're coding with AI** - ChatGPT and Copilot are amazing, but they sometimes miss security basics
- **Rapid prototyping** - Building something quick? Don't let security be an afterthought
- **No-code/Low-code folks** - Generated code can have issues, this catches them
- **Your CI/CD pipeline** - Catch problems before they hit production
- **Code reviews** - Run this before you submit that PR
- **Learning security** - Get real-time feedback on what can or is going wrong (and how to fix it)

## üåç Language Support

Works with all the languages you actually use:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx
- **Python**: .py
- **PHP**: .php
- **Ruby**: .rb
- **Go**: .go
- **Java**: .java
- **C#**: .cs
- **Config files**: .json, .yaml, .yml, .env
